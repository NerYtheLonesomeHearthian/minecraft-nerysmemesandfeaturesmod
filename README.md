# minecraft-nerysmemesandfeaturesmod
Repository for the Minecraft mod NerY's Memes&amp;Features Mod (1.12.2).

This mod was made with MCreator.




Description (from Curseforge):

This is a mod that I'm only making for fun, so it isn't gonna recive regular updates and because I'm alone and I don't know much about creating mods (I use MCreator) there will probably be things that are made the incorrect way.

 

This mod is tested with various modpacks and doesen't seem to have incompatibility issues.

 

Comment if you have any questions or suggestions/requests, and I'll see what I can do.

 

List of added things so far:

- The Power Of The Sun (a Final Weapon) and all the necessary items to craft it.

- The natural Spawn of The Sakura Tree. Its wood can be turned into Planks, with Slab, Stairs and Fence.

- The spawn of structures in Overworld (an Old Tower for now).

- Added Future biome with a new tree: The Future Tree. Its wood can be turned into Planks, with Slab, Stairs and Fence.

- Apple Ingot with food version, Armor and all tools.

- Platinum ingot with ore, item, block, armor and tools.

- Dark Diamond gem with ore, item, block, armor and tools.

- New Sword: Power Sword. An OP sword crafted using A LOT of Powers Of The Sun (as well as other things, of course). You'll need to also craft some new blocks. It does 4000 damage and it's unbreakable.

- Added nuggets of: Apple, Dark Diamond, Platinum, Ender Pearl and Diamond.

- Added dark and light blocks with items and craftings.

- Added Light Armor, made with light: It has the same protection as Diamond but it makes you invisible, and the helmet gives you night vision. (The armor is also invisible)

- Added new dimension: The Future. You will need to find the Future biome in the Overworld and take blocks from there to build up the portal. It's an End-like dimension.

- Added new item: Beacon Essence. There is also the block with Slab, Stairs, Wall and Fence.

- Added a "master weapon" that you will find very rarely in blocks thath spawn in the Overworld surface.

- Added Hammer

- Added the Nokia 3310 - really - with Hard Obsidian and Harder Obsidian to craft it. You can make a Hammer out of it, and it's OP (You will need to craft a new block with new GUI, just like with the Power Sword). That hammer is a Final Weapon, it does 5.555.555 damage and is unbrakable, but it's very slow. Also, you will need like 730 Powers Of The Sun. Bruh

- Added new item: Beacon Essence with block, slab, stairs, fence and wall. Craftable using Beacons.

- Added new glass: Concentrated Glass. It's a special type of glass that doesn't let the light pass.

- Added new item: Supreme Star Power: even more precious than the Sunpower Cluster, crafted using 9 of them. Now the Hammer Of The God Of Destruction is crafted using that.

- Added a Cactus for every color.

- Added new item: Invisibility. you can use it for making some objects invisible.

- Added new sword: Light sword. It's half transparent.

- Added new armor: Dark Armor. It's completely black, and a single piece of armor covers more than normal. It's strong.

- Added Black Stone block (using the Blackstone texture from Minecraft 1.16).

- Added Lichen Black Stone block. It's like Grass but on Black Stone.

- Added Basalt block (using the Basalt texture from Minecraft 1.16). It has slabs and stairs in the Top and Side versions.

- Added Magmatic Basalt block (with an animated texture!).

- Added Nether Stem block (using the Polished Basalt texture from Minecraft 1.16). It has Planks with Slab, Stairs and Fence.

- Added Nether Leaves block (well, those are leaves, in fact.).

- Added new biome: Magmatic Wastes. It generates in the Future dimension. It has trees made with Nether stem and Nether Leaves; the terrain is made of Black Stone with Lichen Black Stone on top and there are Basalt Agglomerates, made of Basalt and Magmatic Basalt, that spawn in the air.

- Added new big structure: Future Monument. It spawns in the Future dimension. It contains a lot of loot like normally rare armors and blocks, with two hidden chests with very rare items inside as well.

- Added purified Apple family: By smelting an Apple Ingot you'll get a Purified Apple Fragment. Crafting 9 Purified Apple Fragments into a Purified Apple Nugget and 9 of these into a Purified Apple Ingot will give you more possibilities for crafting: Added full Purified Apple armor, Purified Apple Sword, Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel, Hoe and Block (with an animated texture!). The armor gives you constant saturation, so they are kinda good.

- Added Dark Rod, in contrast with Light Rod, used to craft the Purified Apple set.

- Added The  S T I C K. You craft it with a Light Rod and a Dark Rod.

- Added The Sage's Staff (with a full-custom model, made on Blockbench). It's a Final Weapon. You craft it with the Nokia 3310, two  S T I C Ks and other rare blocks. It is absolutely OP.
