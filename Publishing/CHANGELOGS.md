- New Dark Diamond gem with ore, item, block, armor and tools.

.
1.6:
- Added nuggets of: Apple, Dark Diamond, Platinum, Ender Pearl and Diamond.

- Added dark and light blocks with items and craftings.

- Added Light Armor, made with light: It has the same protection as Diamond but it makes you invisible, and the helmet gives you night vision. (The armor is also invisible)

- Changed Taiga Plains biome into Future biome

- Added new dimension: The Future. You will need to find the Future biome in the Overworld and take blocks from there to build up the portal. It's an End-like dimension.

- Added new item: Beacon Essence. There is also the block with slabs and stairs.

- Added slabs and stairs of the Future Wood and the Sakura wood.

- Added a "master weapon" that you will find very rarely in blocks thath spawn in the Overworld surface.

- Added Hammer

- Added the Nokia 3310 - really- with Hard Obsidian and Harder Obsidian to craft it. You can make a Hammer out of it, and it's OP. (You will need to craft a new block with new GUI, just like with the Power Sword) 

That hammer does 99999 damage and has 99999 uses (I didn't know how to make it umbreakable), but it's very slow.

ATTENTION:

In this version i changed the block & items IDs, so they will disappear from your world if you already played this Mod; Forge should also suggest you to make a backup because things are missing, and you should do that.

I haven't removed anything, those blocks and items are just unknown to Minecraft, who thinks they are different from the old ones because of the IDs, so he removes them from the world.

Now the IDs are a lot better by the way.

- Added Planks for Nether Stem (with Slab, Stairs and Fence)
